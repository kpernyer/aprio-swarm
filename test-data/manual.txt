1. System Overview
=================

The Aprio Swarm Document Processing System is a distributed, high-performance platform for processing large volumes of documents. The system uses a microservices architecture with NATS messaging for communication between components.

Architecture Components:
- Document Reader: Monitors directories and publishes documents to NATS
- Task Generator: Creates processing tasks based on document type
- Worker Pool: Executes document processing tasks
- Result Aggregator: Collects and stores processing results

2. Installation Guide
====================

Prerequisites:
- Rust 1.70+ installed
- NATS server running
- PostgreSQL database (optional)
- Docker (for containerized deployment)

Installation Steps:
1. Clone the repository
2. Build the workspace: cargo build --release
3. Configure NATS connection
4. Start the document reader
5. Start worker processes
6. Monitor system health

3. Configuration
===============

The system uses a YAML configuration file:

```yaml
nats:
  url: "nats://localhost:4222"
  cluster: "swarm-cluster"

document_reader:
  watch_directories: ["/data/documents"]
  supported_formats: ["pdf", "docx", "txt", "html", "md"]
  batch_size: 100

workers:
  text_processor:
    count: 5
    capabilities: ["text_extraction", "language_detection"]
  document_analyzer:
    count: 3
    capabilities: ["content_analysis", "classification"]
  vector_indexer:
    count: 2
    capabilities: ["vector_indexing", "similarity_search"]
```

4. API Reference
===============

Document Processing API:

POST /api/documents/process
- Body: Document metadata and content
- Response: Processing job ID

GET /api/jobs/{job_id}/status
- Response: Job status and results

GET /api/documents/{document_id}/results
- Response: Processed document results

5. Troubleshooting
=================

Common Issues:

Issue: Workers not processing documents
Solution: Check NATS connection and worker capabilities

Issue: High memory usage
Solution: Reduce batch size or increase worker count

Issue: Slow processing times
Solution: Check worker capacity and load balancing

Issue: Document parsing errors
Solution: Verify document format support and file integrity

6. Performance Tuning
====================

Optimization Strategies:

1. Worker Scaling:
   - Monitor worker utilization
   - Scale workers based on document type distribution
   - Use specialized workers for different document types

2. Memory Management:
   - Stream large documents instead of loading entirely
   - Implement document chunking for processing
   - Use memory pools for frequent allocations

3. Network Optimization:
   - Use NATS clustering for high availability
   - Implement message batching
   - Optimize serialization formats

4. Storage Optimization:
   - Use efficient document storage formats
   - Implement result caching
   - Optimize database queries

Performance Monitoring:
- Document processing rate
- Worker utilization
- Memory usage
- Network latency
- Error rates

The system provides comprehensive monitoring through Prometheus metrics and Grafana dashboards.
