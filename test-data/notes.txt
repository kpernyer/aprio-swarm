Meeting Notes - Project Planning Session

Date: 2024-01-15
Attendees: John, Sarah, Mike, Lisa

## Agenda Items
1. Document processing requirements
2. Worker architecture design
3. NATS integration planning
4. Performance targets

## Key Decisions
- Use Rust for high-performance processing
- Implement capability-based worker routing
- Target 10,000+ documents per second
- Support PDF, Word, Text, HTML, Markdown formats

## Action Items
- [ ] Design document reader component
- [ ] Implement real file parsing (not just string simulation)
- [ ] Create NATS message schemas
- [ ] Build worker startup and capability selection
- [ ] Test with real document files

## Technical Notes
The system needs to handle:
- Large document files (up to 100MB)
- Mixed document type streams
- Error recovery and retry logic
- Worker health monitoring
- Dynamic scaling based on load

## Next Steps
1. Create test data directory with real files
2. Build document reader that watches directories
3. Implement actual document parsing libraries
4. Design worker capability selection system
5. Integrate with NATS for messaging
